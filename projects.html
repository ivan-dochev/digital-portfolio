                <h4>Step 1: Database</h4>
                <p>The first thing I did was to design all the models for the items I will be storing on the database. Since I was developing a game, it involved creating models for Pokemon, moves, and trainers. This was a crucial step to ensure that the game's data was well-structured and could be easily accessed and manipulated.
                Once that was done, the final step was configuring to work with Microsoft's EntityFramework.

                <h4>Step 2: Game Logic</h4>
                <p>
                Following the database setup, I implemented the core gameplay loop based on the school assignment's requirements. This included a command-line menu for players to add, list, and evolve their Pokemon. I developed the logic for adding new Pokemon, and listing all caught Pokemon sorted by EXP. The most interesting part was the 'Update' operation â€” the evolution system. I wrote the logic to check which Pokemon were eligible to evolve based on the number of same-type creatures collected, and then updated their stats. Additionally, I implemented a "calculateDamage()" method for each Pokemon subclass, incorporating unique damage multipliers for characters like Pikachu and Eevee, which formed the basis of the combat mechanics.

                <h4>Step 3: Fighting System</h4>
                <p>
                After submitting the project, I decided I want to make it more like a proper game (rather than just a small tool where you type in words and get feedback), so I began work on 
                my combat system. This involved creating a Pokemon factory for random Pokemon generation, which allowed for the ability to add a fight-and-catch system to add more interactivity
                to the project. The success rate of catching a wild pokemon is the same as the percentage of health gone, so for example a pokemon at 100hp when its max is 300hp will have a 67% chance to be caught

                <h4>Step 4: Spectre.Console UI Overhaul</h4>
                <p>
                With the core gameplay mechanics in place, I decided to do a complete UI overhaul using Spectre.Console. This was going to replace the basic console output with a more visually appealing and interactive interface, featuring rich components like tables and colorful text. The goal was to create a more engaging and user-friendly experience, moving beyond a simple command-line tool to a polished console application.

                <p>
                To add more challenge and progression, I finally a gym system. This featured a series of gyms, each with a powerful Gym Leader that players can battle. Defeating a Gym Leader awards the player with a badge and 300 gold, providing a clear sense of accomplishment and a long-term goal for players to strive for. Additionally, while implementing this feature I added a small "Gene-splicing" feature, where players can take two of their pre-existing Pokemon and create a new, much stronger Pokemon which is a combination of the two

            As the solutions architect for Initiate, a B2B AI marketplace, I designed the system architecture and tech stack. Additonally, I developed both the frontend and backend for the product's messaging system, enabling real-time messaging between the SMEs and AI vendors.

                <h4>Step 1: Wireframing</h4>
                <p>The initial phase of the project involved creating a comprehensive wireframe using Figma. This allowed us to establish a clear visual hierarchy and user flow, ensuring an intuitive experience for both SMEs and AI vendors. The wireframe focused on creating a clean and modern interface, with easy navigation and clear calls-to-action. This foundational step was crucial in aligning our team on the product's vision and functionality before moving into development.</p>

                to ensure the user interface was intuitive and visually appealing. I utilized shadcn/ui as the UI library, aiming for a modern yet clean aesthetic, 
                particularly for the real-time messaging components. This involved integrating the frontend with the backend APIs, ensuring seamless data flow and real-time
                communication for the messaging feature, providing a robust and responsive user experience.</p>

            Advent of Code is an online event that provides a series of programming challenges designed to test problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. 
            In 2024, I decided to join the event to test my knowledge to the limits. I ended up doing the first 12 challenges, landing me among 10% of all competitors

                <h4>Step 1: Problem Deconstruction</h4>
                <p>Each Advent of Code puzzle presents a unique challenge. My first step was always to thoroughly deconstruct the problem statement, identify the core requirements, and analyze the provided examples. For more complex puzzles, I would use pen and paper or a whiteboard to visualize the problem, map out data structures, and brainstorm potential algorithms before writing any code. This helped in breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.</p>

                <h4>Step 2: Algorithmic Implementation</h4>
                <p>Once I had a solid plan, I moved on to implementation using Python. The focus was on writing clean, efficient, and readable code to solve the puzzle. This often involved implementing specific algorithms (like pathfinding or graph traversal) and using appropriate data structures. After getting a correct answer for the first part of the puzzle, I would then refactor and adapt my solution for the second part, which often introduced new constraints or a larger scale, testing the limits of the initial approach.</p>
